# Python---Beginner-Rock-Paper-Scissors

The player will be asked whether they want to play as rock, paper, or scissors. If they choose something other than the 3 options, they will be asked again to choose one of the three options. 
After the user chooses an option, the opponent (AI) will randomly choose one of the three options and their choice is shown.
The code will compare these two and inform the user whether they won or lost or tied.
The player is then asked if they want to play again. 
If they want to play again, the entire game (Lines 3-6) is ran again. If they say no, the code thanks them for playing and stops running the code.
